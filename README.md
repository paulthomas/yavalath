# Yavalath

This is an engine and AI player for the [Yavalath][yl] 2-player board
game. The goal is to form 4-in-a-row without first forming 3-in-a-row.

The game has 61 hex tiles, and internally the game state is
represented using a pair of 64-bit bitboards, one for each player. The
rules are encoded as two bit mask tables, and detecting wins and
losses is just a handful of bit operations.

Currently the interface is *very* crude and minimal since the focus is
on creating an AI player. The input must be in [Susan notation][sus].
For example, the upper-left tile is `a1` and the bottom-right tile is
`i5`.

           1 2 3 4 5
        a . . . . . 6
       b . . . . . . 7
      c . . . . . . . 8
     d . . . . . . . . 9
    e . . . . . . . . .
     f . . . . . . . . 9
      g . . . . . . . 8
       h . . . . . . 7
        i . . . . . 6
           1 2 3 4 5

The AI is still ... awful. I'm working on it. It's a [UCT Monte Carlo
tree search][mcts].
